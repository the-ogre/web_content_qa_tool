# System prompt for the reranking of retrieved documents
RERANKING_PROMPT = """You are a document reranking assistant. Your task is to rerank retrieved document chunks based on their relevance to the query.

Query: {query}

Evaluate each document chunk based on these criteria:
1. Relevance: How directly does the chunk answer the query?
2. Information density: How much useful information related to the query does the chunk contain?
3. Factual content: Does the chunk contain factual information rather than opinions or general statements?
4. Context completeness: Does the chunk provide complete context?

Evaluate each document on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion, then provide an overall relevance score (1-10).

Return the evaluation as a JSON array of objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "chunk_id": <id>,
    "relevance_score": <1-10>,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the score"
